**GOALS**
Have a random question appear on screen
User will be able to select an answer from 4 possibilities
If a user is right/wrong, the game will notify them
Have an onscreen score counter
Notify the player they have won once they reach 5 correct answers

**NEXT STEPS** => will be marked off as I go along

- Get JS arrays, variables set up
- Any functions I will need ahead of time?

**NEED**
CSS file that contains:
    - Box for trivia question (text in middle)
    - Box for player input (4 buttons)
    - Box for player score (current game, up to 5)
    - A hidden box for 'wrong' answers that flashes when the incorrect choice is made
    - A hidden or static box for when you 'win'

HTML file will need:
    - DIVS for => Top container (banner)
                    => Player score & WIN boxes
        => Middle container
            => Trivia question box
        => Bottom container
            => Player input box
            => For each button
            => WRONG box (could also be in middle container)
    - Buttons for the possible choices
    - ID's or classes for each button & box onscreen


**Loose JavaScript Logic**
- Try & lay out any global variables that you'll need first

- Need arrays for questions, possible answers, just wrong answers(?), just correct answers(?), empty to store user answer & use length property to see if winning number condition is met(?)

- Add event listeners on the buttons that listen for clicks, will need a function in there as a parameter that will trigger the 'correct' button & add one to the score OR will light up the 'wrong' button & keep their score the same (use alerts for now, can spruce up later if need be)

- Put question possiblities in question box => can then set 1 specific answer to trigger correct & all the others can be wrong

- Will need a condition that checks if the current score is < 5, once it hits 5 it will trigger the YOU WIN message (could flash up too)

- If the winning condition is not met after the event above, will need another function(?) to randomly select & populate a new question & shuffle the current question to the back
