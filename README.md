# User Stories
- As a player, I want to be able to read random questions and a selection of possible answers for each clearly, because that is the base function of the game.

- As a player, I want to be notified when my answer was wrong, and when it was correct, for peace of mind.

- As a player, I want to be able to check my accurate score in the game whenever I want, so that I know when Iâ€™m nearing victory.

- As a player, I want to be notified when the game has reached completion.

# Hurdles
- There were a few components of the game that I wasn't able to complete in time; all visual things in CSS. I believe the biggest hurdle I faced while making this game was managing my time efficiently across the different aspects of the code, and getting one part of it done first before starting on another portion of the code.
